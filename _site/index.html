How you have found yourself here does not matter, what matter is that you are here!
I have created this place in hopes that if you may find some answers that you are looking for.
Also a place where you can find my story. Where you can find resources that you, or a loved
one may need, or possibly your community may need. This is a location of love and hope.
My intention is to spread Suicide Awareness, Mental Illness Awareness, as well as Addiction
Awareness. This is something that effects so many people, it does not discriminate. I hope
that my story can help you. Whether it motivates you, or just gives you awareness of how
these things effect other people. With awareness we can try to make a difference we can try
to prevent tragedy.
</p>
<p>
Here we promote the ideas of self worth. Loving yourself as well as loving those around you.
That there is hope that can be found inside the confines of adversity. That we can use the
success of others to promote and nurture the strengths within ourselves. We can share our
stories, we can make a difference, we can change our surroundings. It may be difficult, you
may feel lost, here you are not lost, you are found! We will succeed and will will do so
TOGETHER!
</p>
